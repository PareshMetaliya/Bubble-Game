Welcome to my first project in the exciting journey of web development! In this project, I've learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including DOM manipulation and event listeners. The result of this learning journey is a simple yet fun game called the Bubble Game.
What is the Bubble Game?
The Bubble Game is a basic web game where you have to pop as many bubbles as you can within a certain time limit. It's a great way to practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while having fun!
